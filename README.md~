# WIS-LSTD Experiments

The main purpose of this project is to provide the python implementation of WIS-LSTD introduced by Mahmood, van Hasselt and Sutton (2014). Additionally, it also provides a random walk experiment to illustrate the usage of this algorithm.

It can be imported as an Eclipse Pydev project.
